abstract = {Document image understanding is an essential process in the digital transformation era. Those systems automatically convert a paper document to a digital document for storing and information extracting. In practice, document layout analysis is a critical step for the success of document image modeling. This paper introduces a page segmentation system based on deep neural networks. Our system uses two auto encoder-decoder networks to segment the text-line and non-text components simultaneously. The paragraph segmentation is then realized based on the text line and separator mask. Besides, the non-text elements are also identified. Our algorithm has been tested RDCL2019. Experimental results show that our method is more stable and more comfortable to adapt with a new format layout than the previous commercial and publishing systems.},

  abstract = {Automatic pattern detection has become increasingly important for
	scholars in the humanities as the number of manuscripts that have
	been digitised has grown. Most of the state-of-the-art methods used
	for pattern detection depend on the availability of a large number
	of training samples, which are typically not available in the humanities
	as they involve tedious manual annotation by researchers (e.g. marking
	the location and size of words, drawings, seals and so on). This
	makes the applicability of such methods very limited within the field
	of manuscript research. We propose a learning-free approach based
	on a state-of-the-art NaÃ¯ve Bayes Nearest-Neighbour classifier for
	the task of pattern detection in manuscript images. The method has
	already been successfully applied to an actual research question
	from South Asian studies about palm-leaf manuscripts. Furthermore,
	state-of-the-art results have been achieved on two extremely challenging
	datasets, namely the AMADI_LontarSet dataset of handwriting on palm
	leaves for word-spotting and the DocExplore dataset of medieval manuscripts
	for pattern detection. A performance analysis is provided as well
	in order to facilitate later comparisons by other researchers. Finally,
	an easy-to-use implementation of the proposed method is developed
	as a software tool and made freely available.},

abstract = {Pattern spotting consists of locating different instances of a given object (i.e. an image query) in a collection of historical document images. These patterns may vary in shape, size, color, context and even style because they are hand-drawn, which makes pattern spotting a difficult task. To tackle this problem, we propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approach based on Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN) as the feature extractor of our system. Using FPN allows to extract descriptors of local regions of the documents to be indexed and queries, at multiple scales with just a single forward pass. Experiments conducted on DocExplore dataset show that the proposed system improves mAP by 73% (from 0.157 to 0.272) in pattern localization compared with state-of-the-art results, even when the feature extractor is not trained with domain-specific data. Memory requirement and computation time are also decreased since the descriptor dimension used for distance computation is reduced by a factor of 16.}

ABSTRACT = {In the framework of palaeography, the availability of both effective image analysis algorithms, and high-quality digital images has favored the development of new applications for the study of ancient manuscripts and has provided new tools for decision-making support systems. The quality of the results provided by such applications, however, is strongly influenced by the selection of effective features, which should be able to capture the distinctive aspects to which the paleography expert is interested in. This process is very difficult to generalize due to the enormous variability in the type of ancient documents, produced in different historical periods with different languages and styles. The effect is that it is very difficult to define standard techniques that are general enough to be effectively used in any case, and this is the reason why ad-hoc systems, generally designed according to paleographers&rsquo; suggestions, have been designed for the analysis of ancient manuscripts. In recent years, there has been a growing scientific interest in the use of techniques based on deep learning (DL) for the automatic processing of ancient documents. This interest is not only due to their capability of designing high-performance pattern recognition systems, but also to their ability of automatically extracting features from raw data, without using any a priori knowledge. Moving from these considerations, the aim of this study is to verify if DL-based approaches may actually represent a general methodology for automatically designing machine learning systems for palaeography applications. To this purpose, we compared the performance of a DL-based approach with that of a &ldquo;classical&rdquo; machine learning one, in a particularly unfavorable case for DL, namely that of highly standardized schools. The rationale of this choice is to compare the obtainable results even when context information is present and discriminating: this information is ignored by DL approaches, while it is used by machine learning methods, making the comparison more significant. The experimental results refer to the use of a large sets of digital images extracted from an entire 12th-century Bibles, the &ldquo;Avila Bible&rdquo;. This manuscript, produced by several scribes who worked in different periods and in different places, represents a severe test bed to evaluate the efficiency of scribe identification systems.},
